lscpu \- CPU architecture information helper
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lscpu
.RB [ \-hp ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B lscpu
gathers CPU architecture information like number of CPUs, threads,
cores, sockets, NUMA nodes, information about CPU caches, CPU family,
model, bogoMIPS, byte order and stepping from sysfs and /proc/cpuinfo, and prints it in
human-readable format. It supports both online and offline CPUs. Alternatively, it can print out in parsable
format including how different caches are shared by different CPUs,
which can also be fed to other programs.
